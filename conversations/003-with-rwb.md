# Conversation with RWB

John: How are you? Since we chatted about Whitehead several times, I thought you might be interested to see that I finally gathered my thoughts about everything, and have started putting them together in a written form. Since I had to pick a name for the GitHub repository, I settled on the name DROPS. The word was picked out from Whitehead's phrase "drops of experience". 

It's just a preliminary sketch, a plan of some kind or other. It follows from discussing the topic with VV, who offered to help boil down Whitehead's scheme to something that's more easily understandable. He's good at doing that, and I was greatly encouraged by his sustained interest. VV suggested Whitehead's scheme was perhaps like sunken treasure that could usefully be surfaced.

Since DROPS goes back to Ward's EPISODES, I decided to mention it on Ward's federated wiki channel, and did so just last weekend. Ward had previously told me I was very welcome in his community and would find support for and interest in my ideas there. In response to my asking for comments about DROPS, Ward was extremely generous and responded himself almost immediately with a long series of comments. He actually reposted his remarks on his wiki. The page is here:

Like EPISODES, and Alexander's original conception of pattern language as described in Timeless Way Of Building, DROPs is explicitly based on the notion of events, that is to say on Whitehead's concept of the event as a nexus of actual occasions. The reference in DROPS to "post-agile" is intended as a reaffirmation of this central aspect, rather than an oppositional stance to the essential practices of, for example, eXtreme Programming or Scrum or anything else that figures under the "agile umbrella". As Ward said, it's a response to the "dilution" of the practices, and the scattering of the light, with the consequential low level of determination the original descriptions contribute to occasions of software development (and of the development of other things).

As I said, it's just an initial sketch, but I do feel it represents "months or years of thinking" as Ward said.

I've been slowly approaching the people I happened to talk about this stuff with, and of course you are one of the first people I wanted to ask.

I hope you feel DROPs is aligned with your approach and values? That is to say: heuristics, responsibilities, consent, and also the experience report work you do. If you had any thoughts, feelings, or opinions about this, I would be very grateful if you might let me know what they are.

I hope all is well with you. I'm sorry this DM has turned out to be a little longer than expected. 

With my best wishes,

John


RWB: Hey John. Would be interesting to have another conversation sometime in the nearish future about your ideas. For now, I think that this needs to be expanded up/explained for anyone to really get the gist of this: "Thus the actual world is built up of actual occasions; and by the ontological principle whatever things there are in any sense of 'existence' are derived by abstraction from actual occasions. I shall use the term 'event' in the more general sense of a nexus of actual occasions, inter-related in some determinate fashion in one extensive quantum. An actual occasion is the limiting type of an event with only one member."

"It is sufficient to say that a molecule in the sense of a moving body, with a history of local change, is not an actual occasion; it must therefore be some kind of nexus of actual occasions. In this sense it is an event, but not an actual occasion. The fundamental meaning of the notion of 'change' is 'the difference between actual occasions comprised in some determinate event.'"

That said, I think the outline of drops of experience and drops of human activity may be missing a few items that I think are maybe important: drops of deciding (maybe that is under agreement), drops of common alignment/goal setting, drops of empathic connection...(I could go on, but I won't).

And even if I might add items I think it is a good characterization/organization as it is. Still think you might be interested in some of the ideas of patterns for human action that Takashi Iba and his lab have been writing, too.

John: Hey! Thanks for the replies. All good points!

Regarding "drops of decisions": "decision" is actually the word Isabelle Stengers uses for Whitehead's actual occasions. They are all decisions. It's actually the word Whitehead uses for the fourth stage of an actual occasion, in which the "satisfaction" finds its actuality in the settled world beyond itself. Whitehead talks about "decision-in" and "decision-out" as the first and last stages, with "process" and "satisfaction" being the second and third stages ("book ended" by previous and subsequent decisions). The settlement is the unity that makes the actual occasion what it is. Whitehead also uses the word "settlement" and "harmony" for this third stage (harmony being the word Christopher Alexander uses for the same concern). The word "decision" also happens to be the one of the most frequently used word in EPISODES, appearing 32 times. ("Development" appears 52 times.) I don't know if you came across Stengers at all, I didn't until recently, but I'm guessing you did. Her book "Thinking With Whitehead" is very highly rated.

By way of explanation, I copied those paragraphs from Whitehead directly because, after trying to summarise the scheme several times, it just seemed that those sentences really define the heart of the scheme, broadening out the notion of 'event' beyond the "limiting type" that we find in such a thing as a "domain event". [...] It will take time, I think, to find a way of saying this that is easier to read whilst not dumbing things down to the point where the meaning is lost. [...] you are more than welcome to contribute, if you would like to. I'd be extremely pleased and grateful and honoured if you did (if that's the right way of saying it).

Back to "decision", I think perhaps there is a "higher grade" of decision (human decisions) that needs special attention. It's probably what I meant by "agreement", but that perhaps speaks to social agreements, and one can also decide something for oneself. I don't know if talking about making agreements with oneself is really what we do, but I suppose we do sometimes (like with new years resolutions). If I decide to make myself a cup of tea, it's perhaps not really an agreement in the normal sense. But certainly, not all decisions are human decisions, and it would be fitting to give attention to the decisions that people make, as a subset of "everything is a decision".

And yes, it is all really directed at humans developing things, so patterns for human action is what it's all about really.... so long as by "pattern" we are now decisively talking about "patterns of events" (as Alexander said in Timeless Way Of Building) where we finally understand what an event is, that "whatever things there are in any sense of 'existence' are derived by abstraction from actual occasions". I will certainly look into what Takashi Iba has been doing. I can admit to never having looked at that. So thank you very much for pointing to that.

Please do "go on" as much as you can. I've not tried to be exhaustive, I'm not even sure that would be possible. I'm not wanting even to exclude anything, just find a way to end up with more than the wishy washy-ness that results from dealing only in abstractions rather than actual occasions. I think that's the "project" here, if there is one.

Many thanks again for your replies. It's good to hear from you, and whenever you are able to spend time discussing this in the "nearish future" please do let me know. Perhaps you, and Ward, and [VV], and perhaps also [EE] if he is still interested, could have a little meeting about it somehow? I emailed [EE] about this a few days ago, but didn't hear back from him so far.
