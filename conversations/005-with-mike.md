# Conversation with Mike

John: Regarding the "hitchhikers guide to the galaxy" (and finding an adequate modern-world answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything... beyond the number 42).....

I just read two book reviews of a book called "Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World" by William Davies.

The second one ended (accidentally, I presume) with the remarkably Whiteheadian phrase: "I could not see a way through its maze of facts and feelings".

It's remarkable that feelings are still considered to be the irrational emotions that we should feel the need to hold at bay in order to allow reason to construct a rational world that is supposed to be the only way to make a world that can work. The review states, "Davies traces it back to the 17th century and to two key developments in the evolution of modern politics: the attempt to distinguish reason from emotion".

The first review that I read over lunch begins with a phrase that is also rather remarkably Whiteheadian: "William Davies is just the kind of sociologist Lanchester might be talking about, the kind we need right now to tease out what Raymond Williams used to call a 'structure of feeling'."

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/nervous-states-how-feeling-took-over-the-world-william-davies-review

But of course, these remarkable phrases are most likely accidental intersections with Whitehead's system, and it is most probably assumed by the authors of these reviews that their readers will remember the notion of feeling in the phrases "structure of feeling" and "maze of facts and feelings" as the notion of 'emotion' that is directly opposed and is understood only to get in the way of 'reason' as that which will save us.

What I find shocking about these pretensions to expertise, consciously constructed to contrast with the false experts they finger in their articles, is that the intellectual resources these self-regarding folk fall back onto are actually the pre-modern, medieval distinctions that Whitehead very carefully, and very reasonably, and very thoughtfully, and with enormous range of feeling, identified as problematic and inadequate, and which he in fact replaced around 90 years ago.

The review continues: "How have we reached this place? Is this a rational way to be? Davies unpicks the history of ideas – Hobbes’s commitment to reason, Descartes’s mind/body split – to show that, as these foundational concepts have been shaken, we have unravelled. The ground no longer feels solid."

The idea of "feeling" described by these professional so-called thought leaders, these well-paid, self-identifying opinion-formers, is a matter of "anxiety", of "nervousness", of "loneliness". Nowhere is it a matter of a subject relating objectively, or an object relating subjectively. True to the inadequate, medieval "two substances" schemes, they imagine themselves standing above and beyond that which they believe they are representing. They lament the spurned experts, which these columnists obviously number themselves amongst, and probably invite to their dinner parties: "Really, they are telling them that their feelings are wrong. But dismissing the irrational does not destroy it."

None of these people seem to understand that Whitehead already destroyed all of the pre-modern concepts they cling to. But it's only by reading and understanding Whitehead's system (or works such as Alexander's that seem to have been illuminated by it, and work that was illuminated by that such as many of things Ward has done) that we can cast light into this self-regarding sewer and see its actual contours in sharp relief. These people are working in the dark, and merely believe they can see. But really they are just circulating commonplaces that they have picked up, whilst settled in their places at the dinner table, positions cemented in place by the alcohol in the wine they drink before they take their drugs. They care about the "concerns" precisely to the extent that they need to in order to pay off their mortgages. I don't mind about this so much, but I would like to object to their claim to understand the world they are incapable of developing. The troubles they report, which they think are below them, in fact surround them, and make them what they are.

At the present time, it seems simply to be true that none of these people have ever heard of Whitehead, or have any clue about his system. And until that changes, one test of understanding Whitehead is being able to see what a broken, anxious, backward, poverty these people think and express.

Perhaps those remarkable phrases which reminded me of Whitehead's system just go to show something that Whitehead himself wrote in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of his book, regarding the relation between rationality, experience, and thought. That is:

"Rationalism never shakes off its status of an experimental adventure. The combined influences of mathematics and religion, which have so greatly contributed to the rise of philosophy, have also had the unfortunate effect of yoking it with static dogmatism. Rationalism is an adventure in the clarification of thought, progressive and never final. But it is an adventure in which even partial success has importance."

Mike: Raymond Williams and his notion of structures of feeling have been one of my anchors for many years. I don’t have a lot handy online to sketch this, but here is something http://foprop.federated.wiki/view/weft---three-landscapes-of-material-existence/view/weft-3---aesthetic-landscape

Sorry, hit the send key . . That page is just opening notes for a complex topic-in-progress. But structure of feeling is a pivotal part of the framing. I’ve no idea how Whiteheadian this is, but I interpret SoF in a very in-the-body, material way.

That ‘foprop’ wiki is background framing for a pattern language of activist life, making ‘the living economy’ through ‘commoning’.  http://2-pattern.federated.wiki/2-commoning---a-pattern-language.html. Again, opening notes for ongoing work.

I have a strong hunch that Williams’ SoF is close to the ‘sankhara’ notion which is central in Buddhist theory of mind. Also, very in-the-body. Again, I have no idea how Whiteheadian that may be - I’m approaching SoF, the ‘dance of knowing’, pattern language and the construction of activist life in a historical materialist mode. Is Whitehead in any sense ‘historical’? In any sense ‘materialist’?

John: Yes actually I was going to say something about Raymond Williams, but I decided put it "out of scope" of my missive this afternoon. I did look quickly to see if he happens to use Whitehead at all, but it seems not, he seems to be in the Marxist tradition, and Whitehead seems not to be mentioned by him? Which is totally fine by me. Marx wrote before Whitehead, and Whitehead doesn't mention Marx in Process and Reality. But I haven't read Raymond Williams' books, so I'm really just guessing here (and open to the possibility that he might have).

Marx's whole analysis, the thing people often bring out, is the "nature = history" notion (to understand something you have to go back to the chain of facts that has brought to us to where we are now), which is the same thing as Whitehead does ("Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited."). It's just that the Marxist tradition seems to be the materialist tradition, famously "historical materialism". Ideas play one of his central categories though. And Marx is forever charicaturing, the figure of the capitalist, and the figure of the worker, as representing the subjectivity of the capitalist and the working classes. So I think it basically tends towards the same thing. This tendency seems to come together in Deleuze.

The thing I find better in Whitehead is that he just makes a clean break. He just breaks with a number of things: most centrally, the two poles (physical and mental) that he posits in all actual occasions. Marx on the other hand talks about the bees not having an idea of what they are doing, they just build their cells. That's a distinction that I think is interesting. Whitehead would say, "how do you know the bees don't have mentality? Have you asked them to write their biography?" He says this about a stone. So if he can say this about a stone, I'm sure he would feel the same way about a bee.

And without putting the mental pole in every actual occasions, and making it be a subject, it's quite hard to see quite when that somehow enters upon the scene. And I don't find it convincing to say that it somehow does. It just seems better to say it's there from the start.

Mike: Raymond Williams was a ‘cultural theory’ and ‘literature/literacy’ guy, and wouldn’t have known of Whitehead, or seen him as being in his tradition. Williams came out of Marxism, as you say, and a tradition of ‘culture and society’ thinking starting with Ruskin. The thing I value in Williams is exactly that he is centrally oriented to ideas and to feelings (in something like a Whiteheadian sense) while also being history- and action-oriented, following Marx. So, a more subtle take on what’s ‘material’.

The buddhist theory of mind gets even more subtle (phenomenological) regarding what’s material.

John: It's the "bifurcation of nature" that Whitehead objects to. And I think that the heartless socialism (Stalinism for example) that people find distasteful kind of does actually follow from the materialist analysis, even though it does centrally involve the "world of ideas" as one of the seven poles through which history unfolds. So I think those are the points of similarity and difference. But, look, I'm just an engineer, I'm not a scholar, and I'm just saying what I've gathered from looking into this from time to time.

Mike: Williams and the buddha are both good at not bifurcating!

John: As I said, I think the two things come together in Deleuze. But in Deleuze you don't get the clean system that Whitehead makes. Deleuze doesn't really do systems ("concepts don't fit together like jigsaw pieces"). Whitehead's system is just a fabulous system of ideas. And you can look at the two opposing poles in dialectical materialist as both being Whiteheadian subject-superject, as enduring objects, that together constitute a discord that the universe is inclined toward finding a settlement of, one way or another: the slogan "socialism or barbarism" captures that quite well.

Mike: The ‘pattern language of commoning’ I linked to above is definitely about the resolving of ‘socialism or barbarism’! Barbarism pretty much on the cards these days :-(

John: In my reading, the Whiteheadian process of becoming that finds a settlement of this discord is expressed beautifully in Grundrisse (ch 10.):

"The result is: the tendentially and potentially general development of the forces of production – of wealth as such – as a basis; likewise, the universality of intercourse, hence the world market as a basis. The basis as the possibility of the universal development of the individual, and the real development of the individuals from this basis as a constant suspension of its barrier, which is recognized as a barrier, not taken for a sacred limit. Not an ideal or imagined universality of the individual, but the universality of his real and ideal relations. Hence also the grasping of his own history as a process, and the recognition of nature (equally present as practical power over nature) as his real body. The process of development itself posited and known as the presupposition of the same. [33] For this, however, necessary above all that the full development of the forces of production has become the condition of production; and not that specific conditions of production are posited as a limit to the development of the productive forces."

https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch10.htm

There's that word "grasping" which is "prehension" in Process and Reality. This "the grasping of his own history as a process" is a contribution that Whitehead makes, and he elevates it to a cosmological process. I think that's what Deleuze recognised, and was blown away by.
Furthermore from Grundrisse (moving from ch 10, to ch 14.):

"Capital itself is the moving contradiction, [in] that it presses to reduce labour time to a minimum, while it posits labour time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth. Hence it diminishes labour time in the necessary form so as to increase it in the superfluous form; hence posits the superfluous in growing measure as a condition – question of life or death – for the necessary. On the one side, then, it calls to life all the powers of science and of nature, as of social combination and of social intercourse, in order to make the creation of wealth independent (relatively) of the labour time employed on it. On the other side, it wants to use labour time as the measuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created, and to confine them within the limits required to maintain the already created value as value. Forces of production and social relations – two different sides of the development of the social individual – appear to capital as mere means, and are merely means for it to produce on its limited foundation. In fact, however, they are the material conditions to blow this foundation sky-high."

So I also think the Mercers and the Murdochs and the Putins and the others all know this very well. And they are just funding all the Nazis to destroy all the possibilities for organising democratically to push society past this "sacred barrier". Also the "pragmatism" of the free market liberals bailing out the banks and starving the populations with austerity and so on, they are just trying to hold these forces at bay. The proper name for what they are doing is corruption. It's power, corruption, and lies. And the coordinated international actions we've been seeing are really a planned project that they need to do. From their point of view, they have to do it. That's why they have to attack the environmental movements, attack the systems of justice, and the liberals (the "snowflakes"), and basically propagate a permanent world war that somehow allows commodity markets to continue. Hence the "culture war", and the surveillance systems like Facebook and Google become useful. Elections can be rigged in new ways. Fake news becomes a big thing. The hopes of the internet can be bent backwards. But they are really undermining their own foundations. The question is, can something be constructed anyway, despite all of this. That's what we don't know.

But Whitehead doesn't seem to have involved himself in these political concerns. He just seems happy to do what he can.

He sets himself an ambitious goal:

"At the end, in so far as the enterprise has been successful, there should be no problem of space-time, or of epistemology, or of causality, left over for discussion. The scheme should have developed all those generic notions adequate for the expression of any possible interconnection of things."

And he writes something which I feel is very relevant and useful for the above political considerations:

"A chain of facts is like a barrier reef. On one side there is wreckage, and beyond it harbourage and safety. The categories governing the determination of things are the reasons why there should be evil; and are also the reasons why, in the advance of the world, particular evil facts are finally transcended."

The consideration of religion is another point of comparison between Whitehead and Marx ("Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people"). But I'll leave this there for now. :-)

Regarding the Marxist classes, whilst some of us orbit around having capital that we use to buy raw materials and labour to make products and services that we sell or rent in order to achieve more capital ("the condition of being a capitalist"), and whilst some of us orbit around selling labour time in order to get money to buy the commodities we need to replenish our ability to work the next day ("the condition of being a worker"), as Deleuze said between pure wealth and naked labour there is an indeterminate zone that each of us finds ourselves in. So "workers" can own stocks/shares and houses and maybe a second house they rent out. Also "capitalists" have to spend time addressing their concerns even if that is the work of managing their investment portfolios or calling their investment managers from time to time and planning their next holiday or preparing for the next party. There are poles and tendencies, rather than fixed roles. I wasn't so much trying to say I subscribe to this, but rather to see these two poles as "facts" that are felt, which together can't really be said to be a harmonious settlement ("the end of history").

That's not because some people just don't feel happy. It's because there needs to be a return on investment, a profit, and that means having a competitive advantage. So competition drives innovation, but then innovations are circulated, and the circulation of innovations reduces the advantage that one enterprise has over another. And this becomes a separate process of development, incremental and iterative processes of development, such as XP and other patterns of development and design which wiki was developed to discuss. Ad hoc occasional innovations by the factory owner tend towards the existence of separate development agencies: management consultancies, technology consultancies, web development agencies. But this innovation, the accumulation of science and technology, takes on an increasingly social character, and it cuts both ways. It leads to new products and services, new offerings within a particular society constructed around markets and capital and commodification. But it also takes process as it's object, and society is a process (capital as value-in-motion), and so the particular process of organising society around buying and selling commodities also becomes an object of development. That's the "sacred barrier" which the development of development proposes to lift, permanently. In simple terms, the system isn't stable or permanent, because it depends on innovation which does nothing if it doesn't challenge and rework states of affairs. Capital desires to have one without the other, but that's not how it works. Hence "disruptive" becomes a "thing", it becomes acceptable, and even appealing. But it also has its taboos (market failures) and it's conventions (Zuckerberg's grey t-shirts). The innovations consultants talk about "harnessing innovation": the recommend the executives cut people some slack, but also try not to lose control.

This is simply to say that the current arrangements, in which we find ourselves, are threatened by themselves. They necessarily involve development and innovation, and innovation in development, which plays into a process of becoming that has the potential to terminate in a unity or settlement that transcends these unsettled and unsettling arrangements. The result would be something new, something inconceivable, something that we aren't familiar with at the moment and so find it hard to imagine because it lies outside our actual experience ("the future doesn't exist"). And that process of becoming, in so far as it accomplishes anything, is objectively a process of development, tending towards a universal process of development that has an increasingly social character. And that seems to be expressed by the collective writing process that wiki was designed to support, and continues to be developed to improve. So I suppose, in my understanding at least, this is the context within which "writing together" and "pattern language" and "wiki" became a "thing".
