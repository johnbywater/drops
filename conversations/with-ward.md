## Discussion about DROPS

https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fedwiki:matrix.org/$1581253715278220EzkWs:matrix.org

John:

I don't know what people may think and feel about the following, but I would love to hear what people in this channel might have to say about this "plan" before I spend much more time on it:
https://github.com/johnbywater/drops/blob/master/README.md


"DROPS is an approach to development built up of actual occasions."

Ward:

You are on to something here. I've read it slowly and carefully several times now. I find that it holds together on dimensions that I don't fully understand. By this I mean that the parts that I do understand do not in any way conflict with each other. If I were asked to sum it up I could only quote you: "the concept of actual occasions of experience".

Since this has been written under source control, I have also read your commits in order. This gives me a sense of where you chose to anchor your thinking as you set out to write.

You start this inquiry with a short list of points and a longer list of examples that illustrate the comprehensive nature, the expressive range, of those points applied. This one commit is already complete within itself. A summation of months or years of thinking.

Context

Since you mention EPISODES in good light I think it might be encouraging to recall the circumstances of its creation. It may have similarities to your position at the moment.

I have always been about as old as general purpose computing since EDSAC and I appeared in the same year. (EDSAC was the first computer build without a specific purpose in mind. That is, it was of general purpose.) I learned of computing in my teens and was twice that when I encountered the refined abstractions of Smalltalk and set out to understand their full consequences. At that point in my 30s I had half a lifetime of experience to draw upon.

Although Smalltalk organized its worlds around things, objects, much more fundamentally it was about the exploration of things, things of the imagination at that. Remember that it was itself born over a decade within the Learning Research Group at PARC.

Kent and I had already devoted months exploring with Smalltalk. We built things to see if we could and then played with them to see what else they had to teach us. We sought to explain the methods that had evolved. We had some advantage here since we had done must of that exploration together and had articulated much of what we discovered making up new words if they were needed.

We kept pushing on pattern language which seemed powerful enough to describe our experiences in their most essential. By the time I wrote EPISODES I was several years into commercial software development with the latitude to work the way Kent and I had and see how it applied within a more directed environment. The objects we had by then constructed were interesting but not quite as interesting as how we moved through a complex domain, learning and then turning what we learned into durable value to be sold.

(This has turned out to be a little longer than expected. My point arrives soon.)

Insight

I wrote EPISODES in an abbreviated style. I had lots to say all based on recent experience. I quit half way through and dubbed my work Part 1. I blamed this on the page count limit but it was really me getting tired.

I have gone back to read this just to make sure I said something as profound as what you have read into it. I did say it. And it might not have been said more clearly if I wrote Part 2. At some point during the writing process I stoped and asked myself, what one word describes this bundle of experience. I chose "episodes". I thought that my choice needed some explanation and those few sentences are where you and I connect.

We are particularly interested in the sequence of mental states that lead to important decisions. We call the sequence an episode.

I could have called the paper "A Method for the Incremental Discovery and Maintenance of Business Objects". I had pointed out earlier that year that one rarely gets the names of their objects right and would be wise to rename them once they understood what they did. I chose EPISODES because I thought it might fit into a system of names. See https://wiki.c2.com/?SystemOfNames

John:

Ward, these comments are so generous, I'm totally blown away. Thanks so much



## Discussion about Dennett

"The problem, obvious to anyone who has studied Whitehead’s work closely, is that Dennett’s approach to the evolutionary emergence of religion presupposes what Whitehead’s philosophy of organism so passionately protests against: the bifurcation of nature."
https://footnotes2plato.com/2015/04/26/religion-in-human-and-cosmic-evolution-dennett-whitehead-and-bellah/

It turns out there's a number of articles discussing Dennett and Whitehead. This one is very readable, and sets things out quite well:

"Whitehead's Even More Dangerous Idea"
http://horizons-2000.org/5.%20Mind%20and%20Metaphysics/Web%20papers/Peter%20Farleigh,%20Whitehead%27s%20EvenMore%20Dangerous%20Idea.htm

"Events, as we commonly refer to them, are happenings in certain places, at certain times, for particular durations - everything from the fall of an autumn leaf, to the fall of the Roman Empire. We can discuss such events by starting with concepts of matter in motion, but such an approach is a limited case of a more general view that regards matter, itself, as aggregates of sub-atomic events, as modern physics has shown. Sub-atomic events are instances of the fundamental types of events that Whitehead takes as the basis for his ontology.

"Bertrand Russell felt the force of this idea. In 1914 Whitehead convinced him "to abandon Newtonian absolute time and space, and also particles of matter, substituting systems of events" and this "fitted in well with Einstein". (Ushenko 1949) He further elucidated the Whiteheadian concept of matter when he later wrote: "An event does not persist and move, like the traditional piece of matter; it merely exists for its little moment and then ceases. A piece of matter will thus be resolved into a series of events. Just as, in the old view, an extended body was composed of a number of particles, so, now each particle, being extended in time, must be regarded as composed of what we may call 'event-particles'. The whole series of these events makes up the whole history of the particle, and the particle is regarded as being its history, not some metaphysical entity to which the events happen." (Russell 1969)

"Whitehead does not confine his fundamental unit-events to the sub-atomic level, his is not a 'quantum mechanics' theory of mind per se. Rather, his speculation is that there are universal principles operating at all levels in nature, quantum mechanical phenomena being instances of these principles at one extreme, and psychological phenomena being instances at another. So not only the low-grade sub-atomic events, but also atomic, molecular and cellular events count as fundamental Whiteheadian 'actual occasions'. The most complex high-grade events are the most familiar ones-moments of human perception, or percipient events. All of these occasions have to some degree, a subjective or psychophysical nature. An occasion, technically for Whitehead, being an "occasion of experience", though not necessarily a conscious experience."

This is much longer, and I haven't read all of it (but is by somebody I follow on Twitter and like):
https://footnotes2plato.com/2015/04/26/religion-in-human-and-cosmic-evolution-dennett-whitehead-and-bellah/

PS There seems to be some reluctance to distinguish in the secondary literature what an actual occasion is and isn't, beyond something that is very tiny. As far as I can understand, anything that is indivisible in its subjective aim or in the unity of its settlement or harmony (however divisible it becomes in its resulting physical actuality) is an actual occasion. An event that is two successive actual occasions is an event that is not an actual occasion. But otherwise, there is no need (and it is therefore probably a mistake) to imagine that actual occasions are just tiny little things that you can't point to. I'm not a scholar of Whitehead (or any other kind of scholar), so this is just my understanding, and as I said, I haven't so far stumbled on anybody actually committing themselves to this, but I just can't see (at the moment at least) how this understanding is a mistaken understanding. For example, the atomic database transaction makes the commit of several database records be an actual occasion, and that's the whole purpose (the records then being divisible which can be shown by deleting or updating some of them but not all of them). Having said that, I'm keeping an open mind, because I've only been looking at this for a few years, and it's a topic that I've had no training or supervision in developing my understanding....

I didn't realise that Whitehead finally convinced Russell of the scheme of ideas in Process and Reality. Previously, I had just seen that Russell had found Process and Reality to be a bit odd and not something he really felt was particularly interesting or something that really made very much sense to him. But it seems clear that at the latest in 1969 Russell had got up to speed with what Whitehead had published in 1929. So I guess that gives all of us an excuse for not immediately comprehending what on earth Whitehead was going on about....

Anyway, it seems to me there is a definite incompatibility between the Alexandrian pattern language scheme, which rejects the bifurcation of nature, and the notions that Dennett and others continue with. The rejection of the bifurcation of nature that Alexander's work depends on seems clearly to be sourced from Whitehead, so those of us who adhere to the original pattern language scheme have already decided to be Whiteheadian in their view of the world, and so should probably take care to avoid mixing this somehow with incompatible notions, and thereby accidentally constructing a veritable confusion for ourselves, and then perhaps for others. Sorry to go on about this for so long. I do feel this is very relevant, but appreciate that some may not. So thanks for being patient. I'll leave this there for now. I do hope that helps....
