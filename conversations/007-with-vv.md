VV: Thanks for the summary and background. I thing the "actual occurrences" as events/entities are finally sinking in. What did it was you indicating that the aggregate is the nexis of actual occurrences and that they have "personal order." I think that I need to see why all this matters in terms of why would we choose to change long-standing definitions and patterns by reintroducing from 100+ years ago. I think I mentioned this before, and it's not that I disagree. There is value in this pov, but if we use a lot of our own energy to teach people something different and they use a lot of their energy to change their thinking, vocabulary, and approach to development, will it be better that the status quo?

John: You ask a good question.

Thanks for looking through what I wrote.

I don't think there's any need (or intention on my part) to replace DDD terminology. There is, however, a question of how Whitehead's system relates to DDD terminology.

Just to keep it short and sweet, I think there are three things to say:

1. Whitehead's system is more general than DDD. So looking at the structure of an event sourced model, there is: (a) the domain model; which is made of (b) aggregates; the current state of which are "projections" of a sequence of (c) domain events. The "domain event" is an example of an actual occasion. The "aggregate" is an example of a nexus that has personal order (actual occasions are ordered serially). The "domain model" is an example of a corpuscular society (nexus with many strands of personal order). There are many more distinctions in Whitehead's system that aren't exampled in DDD (although obvs there are many more things in DDD than model-aggregate-domain event). That's the first point: Whitehead is "greater than" DDD, in that you can model DDD with Whitehead's system, but you can't model Whitehead's system with DDD. That's not because DDD isn't adequate for its purpose (let's say "tackling the complexity in the heart of software"), but because Whitehead's system is designed to be a "cosmology" or "metaphysics" (a system of ideas) that was intended to have all the "generic notions adequate for the expression of any possible interconnection of things". So DDD (and probably most things) is a subset of Whitehead's system, and Whitehead's system is a superset of DDD (and probably everything else). In simple terms, Whitehead's system goes above and beyond DDD, or even pattern language which is the system in which DDD was consciously expressed by Eric Evans (he told me he paid very close attention to Alexander's scheme, and tried to be faithful to it).

2. Because Whitehead's system is more general, it's not just a way to understand DDD, but a way to understand and adequately express anything. These other things are really unlimited, but I tried to capture the scope in the README page on the DROPS repository. If DDD directs attention to the design of a software system, we can look for these other things firstly by looking at what neighbours (what is next to) a software system. There is the process of development. There is the computer system in which the DDD software is running (e.g. the "process event" which includes "domain events" but which Eric had trouble identifying as a distinct occasion from the domain events, and so have several others I've spoken with). There is the user experience of using the software, and the process which they are involved in. There are all the other human processes (the "domains" which are supported by DDD, and modelled by domain events, but which have "outcomes" that are supported but not necessarily included in the domain model). There is understanding the creative process of making something new, which developing must involve but which somehow doesn't seem to be very well described, or often provided for. And then there is the world beyond that, human society, and then the context within which human society exists (let's say "the environment" on Earth). And so on, the whole universe. So it's not really a better way of doing DDD, and there is no reason to replace DDD terms in DDD with Whitehead's terms. But, in short, the only way to avoid cargo culting the stuff we do is to fall back onto a broader system with which the things we do can be rejuvenated (this is something Ward and I were actually talking and agreeing about - he mentioned the phrase cargo culting). The way to look at this from an economic point of view is the notion of economy of scope: having one general system of ideas that is actually "adequate for the expression of any possible interconnection of things" reduces the common cost of approaching to understand and express anything to a minimum. That's why there's nothing so practical as a *good* theory, and (of all the systems of ideas I have encountered) Whitehead's theory is the most practical of all, because it is the most general.

3. With a greater expression and understanding of things, and by knowing that things we contribute to are particular occasions ("decisions"), we can be more definite in our actions, and increase the possibilities to accomplish more adequate settlements, causing greater satisfaction, in the things we create.

VV: Great explanation.
