# Conversation with DH

February 2020

[edited discussion]

John: Just wondered what you think about this:
https://github.com/johnbywater/drops

Ward Cunningham kind of blew me away yesterday with his remarks:

"You are on to something here. I've read it slowly and carefully several times now. I find that it holds together on dimensions that I don't fully understand. By this I mean that the parts that I do understand do not in any way conflict with each other. If I were asked to sum it up I could only quote you: 'the concept of actual occasions of experience'.

"Since this has been written under source control, I have also read your commits in order. This gives me a sense of where you chose to anchor your thinking as you set out to write.

"You start this inquiry with a short list of points and a longer list of examples that illustrate the comprehensive nature, the expressive range, of those points applied. This one commit is already complete within itself. A summation of months or years of thinking."

DH: Hi John, that's super cool that you got some nice feedback from Ward
I have read the drops page and I have to confess that I don't totally understand what you are trying to do with it. I know you well enough to know that you've probably understood something that I do not, but I'm afraid I'm not totally getting it
all I can say is what I see from a very superficial reading is different time-horizon granularities of events

Makes me think of pace layering https://blog.longnow.org/02015/01/27/stewart-brand-pace-layers-thinking-at-the-interval/

John: Thanks! That Pace Layering is quite similar isn't it! Interesting talk, maybe there is a video on YouTube?

Regarding "getting it", if you read the XP book by Kent Beck, he mentions Ward's EPISODES was the precursor. Then if you read EPISODES you can see that it's all about events, specifically creative becomings that we can't know in advance (Ward told me he was trying to tell people not to be scared about that). He wrote it as a pattern language, because he had just started discussing with Christopher Alexander. So then if you look at pattern language, it turns out that Alexander was quite specific that he is looking to describe patterns of events, because that's what's real. He was at Harvard shortly after Whitehead, and quotes Whitehead, who it turns out was massively influential for Alexander. So then if you look at Whitehead's book Process and Reality, which is an acknowledged masterpiece of philosophy, you see the idea is that the actual world is built up of what he calls actual occasions, which he says are the actual entities, and that everything else is an abstraction from them. There's quite a specific structure and system to Whitehead's ideas, which has been dissipated by the time it gets to people like Martin Fowler and Cockburn, so when they lead out the abstraction knows as the Agile Approach they basically made the wrong abstraction, so people talk about agile teams and projects and so on as that's real, with realising what Whitehead and Alexander and Cunningham were feeling. So this is just bringing it all back home to the original concept behind everything we have been led into doing with software. Ward I think can see this, which is why he was so attentive and generous in his remarks. Looking forward, the project is to cover all the same ground, but paying more attention to describing actual occasions rather than drifting iff into relatively indeterminate abstracted stuff that is properly described with the term "half baked", stuff people get into trouble with because actually it doesn't contribute as much determination to the actual occasions they can only try to create as they really need. Does that make more sense?

Did that make more sense?

John: Haha, thanks. I'm very interested to hear what you have to say. I know you are a busy manWinking face

DH: I think my initial reaction is that I don’t feel like I understand what problem you’re trying to solve.

John: Since I posted this, I've been discussing this further, very productively, with Ward Cunningham, and VV, and RWB and a few others. So it would be great to hear what you have to say about it.

Ok, well that's a good place to start!

I guess it would be an improvement if that were somehow expressed. But perhaps you have some idea? Maybe not.

DH: Seems like you trying to create some meta framework for describing “development”

But perhaps I’m influenced by your past work in assuming that

John: It's not really a meta framework, but rather putting the train back on the rails of the original concepts that pattern language, and actually EPISODEs were applications of. It's taken me a while, too long perhaps, but it turns out that Alfred North Whitehead's Process and Reality is the system of ideas that Christopher Alexander's work is merely an application of in the architecture of the built environment. Does that make sense, in itself, as a claim at least?

DH: Yes as a claim it makes sense!
Haven’t read the whitehead book obvs

John: If people were just to use their intuition, it wouldn't be so bad. But we have a complicated tangled web of bullshit proposals that don't hang together and don't actually constitute these actual occasions very well.

You can see in EPISODES what Ward thought about it, and he said it was totally ignored.

DH: ok so.. go back to first principles and rebuild a narrative about what software is and how to think about it that isn't broken.

John: What he said reflected what Alexander was saying very well.

And what Alexander was saying reflects very well what Whitehead was saying.

But after that, things get "diluted". Which is a nice and polite way of saying the story got lost.

So it's not so much that nobody can ship working code.

It's that if we can go back, and realise what Whitehead, and Alexander, and Ward understood, then we'd do a lot better.

And if we don't use our intuition, to make sense of things that don't actually make sense, then we can't in fact get very much done at all.

DH: My thinking about software lately has been mostly attempting to follow through the consequences of conway's law. That the people and the quality of communication and relationships between people are determinant in the quality of the software. Also Naur's "Programming as theory building" seems to corroborate this.

John: So that's the problem, and DROPS is a solution. But what I wrote is just a plan. The project, if there is one, is to cover al the same ground, with much of the same solutions, but clarify the propositions we have received under the original conceptions.

DH: Have you read programming as theory building? it's a short and very wonderful paper

John: So it starts with the original conception of an "actual occasion" which Ward happened to describe very well. I haven't read that paper. I will read it. Do you have a link?

DH: Conway's law has profound consequences for large scale software development (where it involves teams of people) .. the quality and structure of relationships matters. It sounds obvious but it's amazing how much it is neglected. http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf

John: My position with DROPS isn't that such and such a thing is right or wrong, it's that we are dealing with abstractions as if they are the actual reality. Of course abstractions are also real, but that without going back to Whitehead and learning what is the structure of an actual occasion, the risk is that we fall under the fallacy of presentational immediacy, and of misplaced concreteness. That's not such a terrible thing, but then there's nothing holding us back from falling into supposing the world and the entities are instances of the substance quality categories. And at that point we have wrapped our minds in manacles, and thought is restricted to be effectively uncreative. And that's what "agile team" or "agile project" is. And it's from that position that so many people try to be creative, or assume they are the creative ones and others are just mechanical technicians, or that's it's a logic game, or some other kind of broken painful condition. And it's driving everybody crazy, the more so the harder they try to understand things in this way. And all along we had Whitehead, and Alexander, and Ward's stuff, which is how this all got started. It's just got lost, but I found it again.

So I'm happy to think about any of these ideas, but from now on, I'm looking at them to see how well constituted they are in terms of actual occasions, how well expressed and proposed things are as events. Of course we need abstractions, but we need adequate ones. And if you look at it, with this focus from Whitehead, you can see quite clearly what is actually just bullshit and is never going to work, and what is creative and will help make things happen.

DH: sounds promising, I feel like I should read whitehead if I'm going to offer any helpful input

John: So I'm sure Conway has interesting things to say, about the relation between organisations and software, but since nobody has read Whitehead, unless he's been very careful, to use his feelings and intuition, in the way Ward did with EPISODES, then he probably fell back into ancient and medieval categories, that cannot contribute and should have no place in the modern world of science and technology.
Fowler got it down brilliantly in his Refactoring book, but most other things he says are really bullshit.
I could go around and evaluate other things, but Agile is a mess, whilst XP is great.

DH: sure, I think Conway's stuff is grounded in his own practical experience but I'm not claiming that he has some insightful analysis of everything.

John: There's lots that great. But we should know what Whitehead said. It's quite simple, and it makes things so much more definite. And it's that definiteness that programmers need to bring to their systems, so they work.
And in so far as we don't actually know this, we make things much harder than they need to be.

DH: I've found it helpful

John: Did you ever read EPISODES? Kent Beck mentions it a the start of the original XP book. I remember seeing that reference and not bothering to find out what he was referring to. But just the other day, on Ward's federated wiki chat channel, somebody mentioned this reference, and I remembered seeing it, not know what it was, and just skipping on.

I saw EPISODES just a short while ago when I started looking for things that actually conform with Whitehead's scheme. I did this after Michael Mehaffy (who was Christopher Alexander's student and is basically his best friend, and is still leading the continuing development of Alexander's pattern language legacy) confirmed when I asked him in a private email about 12 months ago, that Whitehead was "enormously influential" for Alexander. I had guessed that he was after reading Whitehead's work, and finding that Alexander's Timeless Way of Building was uncannily similar, virtually an application of Whitehead's scheme. I was reading Whitehead's Process and Reality simply because it was a "process philosophy" (the modern process philosophy) and I was trying hard to find out exactly when modelling events and event sourcing will let me down. And then I found in Whitehead this amazing system of ideas, an event-oriented process cosmology that's largely been overlooked, except for people like Alexander. So when Ward picked up on pattern language, he didn't realise even that Whitehead existed, but nevertheless when he wrote EPISODES he totally nailed it. So that's what I've been explaining to Ward, who totally gets it now. Ward started calling it the Ward-Whitehead coincidence. But first he just said every time he talks about process, his wife says his head starts to swell, and then he changed the subject. So it took me about three goes to get him talking about EPISODES, and what happened to it. He told me it was totally ignored, and he just did Wiki instead, supporting everybody else writing their patterns. That's how we get to Agile, which people then understand as the quality which a substantial thing like a team can have. In other words, all the progress the Whitehead made, in the 1920s at the start of the modern world, and all the great work the Alexander did in applying Whitehead's scheme, and all the great intuition and feeling that Ward had based on his experience and exposure to Alexander's work, it all got lost.

But of course, since the actual world is built up of actual occasions, for anybody to make anything happen, you have to feel this stuff to some extent or other. It's just that there's a whole detailed scheme of ideas, that Whitehead spent virtually his whole life figuring out. I learned yesterday that Whitehead eventually convinced Russell about all of this. So it's not just some second rate shit. It's totally amazing, and we actually all need to understand this.

Of course, I'm just me, little old me. And it's taken me a while to figure this out. And it takes some time to explain it to people. But Ward and Vaughn and Rebecca and a few others seem to get it, and they have been encouraging me to get it out there, and to make it make sense. So I just thought I'd run this past you, knowing you are more than capable of understanding it, and hoping that perhaps you have time and are interested sufficiently to just give this a little bit of energy and attention.

And then when we have a little group, we can go back over the same ground, and actually make a development process that is much more definite and determined that we have at the moment. And then perhaps we can make a world that works, rather than the one we have at the moment that just doesn't work very well, as everybody can see.

I'll leave it there for now. but please do, if you can, read these messages, and give it some thought. And remember what's difficult about the way I've introduced this to you, so that I can make it easier for others to follow. That's exactly what Vaughn Vernon offered to help me to do. But we need a few people to bounce this around, and make it make sense.

I've got some more things to say, but I'm worried that I've already said far too much. So please read what I've written, if you can. And try to see what I'm talking about. At the core, there's something which is very simple, which you will already know.



DH: reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead#Philosophy_and_metaphysics
you may hate this, but I have to say that it all sounds very similar to buddhist philosophy
which, for example asserts that nothing has a separate independent existence but only exists in relation to other things
that nothing is permanent
this is not in any way to dismiss it.. on the contrary it makes a lot of sense to me

John: No I don't hate it, Whitehead says this. The only thing is that Whitehead created from that rich history of feeling the modern process philosophy that Alexander applied brilliantly when he invented pattern language. So I would think that although it is reminiscent of Buddhist thought, Whitehead created something which is a novel advance on everything else, and in doing so created the modern process philosophy that we moderns actually need.

Alexader had to find some way of making something that made some sense to the architects of the built environment. And if you read Alexander's work, having read Whitehead, you can see that he didn't really mangle anything at all. The gate in Timeless Way of Building, for example: you go through it and leave the patterns behind. At that point Alexander states quite explicitly that the patterns don't matter, they have taught you to be receptive to what is real, having described patterns as descriptions of the events that make something alive.

It's wonderful really. Even calling it beautiful is really to fall before the first hurdle.

DH: quoting the Wikipedia article now “if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist.[100] Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they are what the thing is.”

Very interesting and I would concur

John: Yes, it's interesting that if you think about what the first actual entity could be, there isn't an answer. Which corresponds, amongst other things, to the conclusion in quantum mechanics that we are left with causality but not being able to expect to fully understand nature

“There is no first principle which is in itself unknowable, not to be captured by a flash of insight. But, putting aside the difficulties of language, deficiency in imaginative penetration forbids progress in any form other than that of an asymptotic approach to a scheme of principles, only definable in terms of the ideal which they should satisfy.

“The difficulty has its seat in the empirical side of philosophy. Our datum is the actual world, including ourselves; and this actual world spreads itself for observation in the guise of the topic of our immediate experience. The elucidation of immediate experience is the sole justification for any thought; and the starting-point for thought is the analytic observation of components of this experience. But we are not conscious of any clear-cut complete analysis of immediate experience, in terms of the various details which comprise its definiteness. We habitually observe by the method of difference. Sometimes we see an elephant, and sometimes we do not.”

Honestly, Whitehead writes very well. It's a little bit Victorian, but he was a massive fan of Wordsworth, and he wrote lots of books, so if you just read it at a steady pace, a bit at a time, it will make perfect sense. He really explains things very well. Including the structure of his approach, which is effectively an incremental and iterative approach, unfolding the whole, by "recurring" to the topics over and over, adding something each time. The only difficulty is that it's really quite unfamiliar to us. So you just have to give yourself time to let your brain catch up. And I've told you what the core idea is anyway: the concept of an actual occasion, the "actual entities" of which "the world is made/built up", each of which is a creative novel advance, each of which includes a mental and a physical pole, avoiding the "bifurcation of nature", each of which has four stages: (1) the "datum" which is the feelings that are the relations to other feelings in previous actual occasions, (2) the "process" which answers the question of what the actual occasion is to be, (3) the "settlement" which is the unity or harmony that makes the actual occasion what it is, and (4) the decision which is the actuality of the settlement in the world beyond the actual occasion.

That's the basic story anyway. So hold on to that, and you won't go wrong. Just take it as a puzzle and try to build up the picture, and expect to be told all of the answers, which you will be by the end.

I haven't actually read the whole thing, but I've read the first part a number of times. and I've plundered through the rest of it, in an attempt to get what he's talking about, without actually reading the whole thing. But I'm going to. I just have my limits like everybody else. Part 1 is sufficient to give you the whole idea. And the rest just elaborates and expands, in necessary ways, but you'll get it soon enough, form read the first few chapters.
