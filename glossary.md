**Actual occasion**

Actual occasions become and then perish into stubborn fact. They don't move or otherwise change. They are what they are. The becoming of an actual occasion is a creative process that culminates in a novel advance. The subjective aim functions as a proposition, and lures feelings. A subjective aim conditions the creativity that exists beyond the actual occasion. A feeling is a process of appropriation that results in the subjective objectification of other actual occasions. The process of the actual occasion answers the question of what the actual occasion will be, by finding a settlement. In this process, some feelings will be eliminated. Eternal objects ingress into the actual occasion. The final settlement has no incompatible feelings, and so the settlement is also a harmony. The actual occasion is the unity of the settlement, and it is indivisible in this sense. The settlement is decided by its actuality in the physical world, which is a divisible multiplicity of factors.

"No actual entity can be conscious of its own satisfaction; for such knowledge would be a component in the process, and would thereby alter the satisfaction. In respect to the entity in question the satisfaction can only be considered as a creative determination, by which the objectifications of the entity beyond itself are settled. In other words, the 'satisfaction' of an 
entity can only be discussed in terms of the usefulness of that entity. It is a qualification of creativity. The tone of feeling embodied in this satisfaction passes into the world beyond, by reason of these objectifications."

**Actual entity**

'Actual entities' also termed 'actual occasions' are the final real things of which the world is made up.

**Actuality**

"But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level. The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, complex and interdependent."

"This whole metaphysical position is an implicit repudiation of the doctrine of vacuous actuality."

**Becoming**

"There is a becoming of continuity, but no continuity of becoming. The actual occasions are the creatures which become, and they constitute a continuously extensive world. In other words, extensiveness becomes, but 'becoming' is not itself extensive."

**Concrescence**

"The concrescence is thus the building up of a determinate 'satisfaction' which constitutes the completion of the actual togetherness of the discrete components. The process of concrescence terminates with the attainment of a fully determinate 'satisfaction'; and the creativity thereby passes over into the 'given' primary phase for the concrescence of other actual entities."

"The ground, or origin, of the concrescent process is the multiplicity of data in the universe, actual entities and eternal objects and propositions and nexus."

**Being**

Beings result from their becoming something.

"Its 'being' is constituted by its 'becoming'. This is the 'principle of process'."

**Chaos**

Non-social nexus.

**Conscious intellectuality**

High grade of mentality.

**Corpuscular society**

"A nexus which (i) enjoys social order, and (ii) is analysable into strands of enduring objects may be termed a 'corpuscular society'." 

**Creativity**

The universal of univerals. Without character. Amoral. Replacement for Aristotle's substance.

Whitehead invented the word 'creativity', we have this word in our language because of him.

"'Creativity' is the universal of universals characterizing ultimate matter of fact. It is that ultimate principle by which the many, which are the universe disjunctively, become the one actual occasion, which is the universe conjunctively. It lies in the nature of things that the many enter into complex unity."

(Note: English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead coined the term creativity in 1927 while delivering the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh. Almost immediately, it became the word of choice in literature, the arts, and science. In fact, the term went into wide use so quickly, we have forgotten its recent origins in the twentieth century.

**Datum**

The content of the experience of an actual occasion. Subjective objectifications.

**Decision**

The fourth stage of an actual occasions, by which its settlement (mental pole) accretes in the physical pole.

**Data**

The decided facts of the settled world.

**Event**

"The word 'event' is used sometimes in the sense of a nexus of actual entities, and sometimes in the sense of a nexus as objectified by universals. In either sense, it is a definite fact with a date."

**Eternal object**

The eternal objects are forms of definiteness, pure potentials, realised in a particular actual entity, contributing to its definiteness. Eternal objects tell no tales of actual occasions, there are no novel eternal objects. Whitehead defines eternal objects as follows: "any entity whose conceptual recognition does not involve a necessary reference to any definite actual entities of the temporal world is called an 'eternal object' "This means that eternal objects include sensory qualities, like colors (blueness or greenness) and tactile sensations (softness or roughness), conceptual abstractions like shapes (a helix, or a dodecahedron) and numbers (seven, or the square root of minus two), moral qualities (like bravery or cowardice), physical fundamentals (like gravitational attraction or electric charge), and much more besides. An eternal object can also be "a determinate way in which a feeling can feel. . . an emotion, or an intensity, or an adversion, or an aversion, or a pleasure, or a pain"

**Fact**

Private facts, public facts, stubborn facts....

**Feeling**

A feeling is a process of appropriation that results in the subjective objectification of other actual occasions as a unified feeling (the feelings that comprise an actual occasion).

Feelings feel feelings that have already been felt.

"A feeling is in all respects determinate, with a determinate subject, determinate initial data, determinate negative prehensions, a determinate objective datum, and a determinate subjective form."

(It's said that Whitehead uses common words in ways that mean something other than the common meaning. However, that suggests the common meaning isn't included in the meaning Whitehead uses the common word to bear. The relation of 'feeling' to 'human feeling' is perhaps much like the relation of 'light' to 'human visible light'. It's a broadening of the spectrum, of the consideration, so that the common case becomes a particular consideration.)

**Many**

"The term 'many' presupposes the term 'one' and the term 'one' presupposes the term 'many'. The term 'many' conveys the notion of 'disjunctive diversity'; this notion is an essential element in the concept of 'being'. There are many 'beings' in disjunctive diversity."

**Mentality**

The actual occasion as a feeling subject.

**Nexus**

A nexus of actual occasions. Different orders of the actual occasions give different types of nexus. A nexus with one member is an actual occasion. A nexus can have social order, when there is a fact of togetherness shared by the actual occasions. A nexus can have personal order, when the actual occasions are ordered serially. A corpuscular society has many strands of personal order. A non-social nexus answers to the notion of chaos.

**Novel advance**

The actual occasion as a unique entity in the universe.

**One**

"The term 'one' does not stand for 'the integral number one', which is a complex special notion. It stands for the general idea underlying alike the indefinite article 'a' or 'an' and the definite article 'the' and the demonstratives 'this' or 'that' and the relatives 'which' or 'what' or 'how'. It stands for the singularity of an entity."

**Personal order**

When the actual occasions in a nexus are ordered serially.

**Potentiality**

An actual entity is potential for a future process.

**Prehension**

A grasping (not a neologism in Process and Reality, this word already existed).

"There are two species of prehensions: (a) 'positive prehensions' which are termed 'feelings,' and (b) 'negative prehensions' which are said to 'eliminate from feeling.' Negative prehensions also have subjective forms. A negative prehension holds its datum as inoperative in the progressive concrescence of prehensions constituting the unity of the subject.

**Process**

Process creates actual entities.

**Reality**

There is no going behind the actual occasions to find anything more real.

**Settled world**

A world of facts.

**Settlement**

The third stage of an actual occasion, its unity and harmony.

"The final phase in the process of concrescence, constituting an actual entity, is one complex, fully determinate feeling."

**Social order**

A fact of togetherness shared by a nexus of actual occasions.

**Subjective aim**

A proposition that lures the feelings that will together become an actual occasion.

"The concrescence is dominated by a subjective aim which essentially concerns the creature as a final superject. This subjective aim is this subject itself determining its own self-creation as one creature."

**Subject**

The actual occasion itself.

**Subjective form**

The form into which an actual occasion appropriate other actual occasions.

**Society**

A nexus of actual occasions that has social order.

**Togetherness**

There is no togetherness except in the becoming of an actual occasion.
