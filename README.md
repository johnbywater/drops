# DROPS
DROPS is an approach to development built up of actual occasions.

Inspired by the turn to eventing in software development, and encouraged both by the modern, event-oriented, process metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead and by Christopher Alexander's pattern language technique for describing patterns of events (exampled brilliantly in Ward Cunningham's EPISODES) the DROPS approach is a post-agile approach to development (of software and other things) which avoids the ancient substance-quality categories that "agile" invokes, and attends instead to the creative becoming of fully determined actual occasions of experience in the society of events we call our world.

## Plan

- Drops of experience: the concept of actual occasions of experience
  - Actual occasions, the actual entities of which the actual world is built up (one subjective aim, two poles, four stages, many feelings, one settlement)
  - Facts of relatedness, or prehensions (feelings, of feelings already felt)
  - Nexus of actual occasions, or public matters of fact (events)
  - Subjective forms, or private matters of fact
  - Eternal objects, pure potentials for the specific determination of fact (forms of definiteness)
  - Propositions, matters of fact in potential determination, impure potentials for the specific determination of fact (theory)
  - Multiplicities (pure disjunctions of diverse entities)
  - Contrasts, or modes of synthesis of entities in one prehension (patterned entities)
