# DROPS
DROPS is an approach to development built up of actual occasions.

Inspired by the turn to eventing in software development, and encouraged by both Alfred North Whitehead's process metaphysics, Christopher Alexander's approach to describing patterns of events called pattern language, and Ward Cunningham's EPISODES, the DROPS approach is a post-agile approach to development (of software and other things) which avoids the substance-quality categories that "agile" invokes, and attends instead to the creative becoming of fully determined actual occasions of experience in the society of events we call our world.

## Plan

- Drops of experience: the concept of actual occasions of experience
  - Actual occasions, the actual entities of which the actual world is built up
  - Facts of relatedness, or prehensions, or feelings
  - Nexus of actual occasions, or public matters of fact (events)
  - Subjective forms, or private matters of fact
  - Eternal objects, pure potentials for the specific determination of fact (forms of definiteness)
  - Propositions, matters of fact in potential determination, impure potentials for the specific determination of fact (theory)
  - Multiplicities (pure disjunctions of diverse entities)
  - Contrasts, or modes of synthesis of entities in one prehension (patterned entities)
